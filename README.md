# Machine-Learning---Project
Fake News Detection project using TF-IDF, Logistic Regression.

## Overview
This machine learning project detects whether a news article is fake or real by analyzing its textual content. It uses TF-IDF vectorization to convert news text into numerical form and applies Logistic Regression for classification.

## Key Features
- Cleans and preprocesses the news text (stopwords removal, tokenization).
- Converts text to numerical vectors using TF-IDF.
- Trains a Logistic Regression model to classify fake vs real news.
- Evaluates the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- TF-IDF (TfidfVectorizer)
- Logistic Regression

## Use Case
Helps combat misinformation by building an automatic system to identify fake news content in social media, blogs, or news platforms.
